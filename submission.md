Dear Editor, 

We are pleased to re-submit our manuscript entitled “In-situ simulation of sea-level rise impacts on coastal wetlands using a flow-through mesocosm approach” for potential publication in Methods in Ecology and Evolution. Our manuscript is likely to be of significant value to readers of the journal because of the need for and momentum towards development of distributed global-scale sea-level rise impact observation networks for coastal wetlands. 

We believe we have addressed the reviewer comments with respect to the novel aspects of our design and within-treatment variability.

Sincerely, 
Joseph Stachelek
